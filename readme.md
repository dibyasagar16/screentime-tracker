# Chrome Time Tracker

A simple and effective Chrome extension to track your time spent browsing, both overall and per tab.

## About the Project

Welcome to the Chrome Time Tracker! This extension is designed for anyone who wants to be more mindful of their browsing habits. Whether you're a developer tracking your focus time, a student trying to stay on task, or simply curious about your digital life, this tool provides a clear overview of where your time goes.

The extension runs silently in the background, measuring the time you spend in Chrome. It not only gives you a total time but also breaks down the usage by individual tabs, so you can see exactly which websites are consuming most of your time.

## Features

- **Total Time Tracking**: Keeps a running total of the time you have spent in Chrome.
- **Per-Tab Tracking**: Shows the time spent on each individual tab/website.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The timer updates in real-time, giving you an accurate picture of your current session.
- **Simple UI**: A clean and easy-to-read popup window that displays your time stats.
- **Lightweight**: Built with efficiency in mind to have minimal impact on your browser's performance.
